## Predicting GDP for CBSA Regions Using Nighttime Satellite Images 

### Question 
NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has been capturing images of the earth since 2012. I stumbled upon their website a few weeks ago and started to browse. I discovered that NOAA has created a webpage with nighttime satellite image tiff files that the public is free to download and use. I started thinking about how these images could be used for machine learning and what the applications of such a project would be. Nigghtime images display lights from different cities and regions across the world... those images are technically 2d arrays with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 on greyscale... I realized I could use these images to make predictions about the United States! Can satellite images be used to predict the GDP of CBSA regions in the United States?
